Hello! This is my simple weather bot
What he can:
    - every morning, at 7 a.m, it sends weather forecast for the current day due to your location
    - change location using /choose_location command or keyboard
    - show forecast for current day using /show_today command or keyboard
    - show forecast for the next 5 days using /show_five command or keyboard

You can see and use source it's source code by reference:
